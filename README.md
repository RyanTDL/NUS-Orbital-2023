# 1. Introduction

**Proposed Level of Achievement:**

Project Gemini

**Aim**

LifeQuest aims to be the ultimate gamified productivity app, turning daily routines into an adventure-filled path towards achieving goals and living a more fulfilling life.


**Our Motivation**

Our motivation for developing this app stems from a personal desire to improve our own daily routine and establish better habits. We believe that many people struggle with finding the motivation and discipline to stick to their goals, and that a gamified approach can provide the necessary incentives to make positive changes.

Our personal experiences with these issues have inspired us to create an app that offers a fun, engaging, and rewarding way to tackle them. By combining game mechanics with productivity tools, our app will help users set goals, track progress, and stay focused on what matters most. We hope that by providing a comprehensive approach to productivity, our app can help users achieve their full potential and lead more fulfilling lives.


**Our Vision**

Our vision for this project is to create a leading gamified productivity app that empowers individuals to achieve their goals and live their best lives. We believe that by harnessing the power of game mechanics and social support, we can create an app that is both fun and effective in improving productivity and overall well-being.

Our app will offer a variety of features, focusing on key areas such as focus and self-improvement, we aim to provide a comprehensive solution to productivity that is both practical and engaging. We envision a future where our app is the go-to solution for individuals who want to become more productive and efficient in their daily lives. By continuously improving and updating our app based on user feedback and the latest research, we hope to stay at the forefront of the gamified productivity market and make a meaningful impact on people's lives.
